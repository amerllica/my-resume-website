Summary
--------
I'm a passionate front-end engineer. I'm experienced in JavaScript, Web/App UI Development, HTML/CSS, ReactJS and React Native. My fields of interest include front-end development, building projects from scratch, maintaining legacy projects, migrating the architecture from legacy to new ones, and UI/UX design. I'm so eager about new technologies and readily accept new challenges. I'd love to write blog posts and articles and answer Stack Overflow questions in my spare timeâ€”also a big fan of using TypeScript in front-end projects.

    - Improved the UX of the mobile app and fix the serious bug that nobody was able to track since. The conversion rate of the Firefox mobile app was zero because of the poor JavaScript codebase. I fixed it and it also solved its other issues.

    - We refactored the search page. We implemented it as a single-page React application. However, it vanished after Digikala's big-bang update.

    - I was involved in the Partial Shipment project which was so valuable for the managers.

    - I got moved to Digikala Mag and comprehensively refactored it. We separated the Desktop and mobile apps.

Then fix it to have a better UX and then assign it to a UI designer, after the design I present it to the customer and got the authorization and start to develop it into an HTML/CSS/JS package. for Responsively I was using Bootstrap and UI Kit, absolutely I read about Less and SCSS and developed my tasks with CSS preprocessors and JavaScript Library like jQuery. after 6 years I saw there weren't any new challenges for me and I wanted to grow up my knowledge and salary. so I decide to leave Douran and join to Digikala.
